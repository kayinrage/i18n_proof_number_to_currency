i18nPROOF NUMBER TO CURRENCY
========= ====== == ========

When you are using I18n and want to use number_to_currency helper you can encounter
some trouble with that. This is my fast solution when all you need is displaying one
currency and localization does not matter.

This plugin extend application_helper with four currency methods (look to example section),
and one that allows you to build your own currency method if you need.

Installation:
=============
ruby script/plugin install git@github.com/kayinrage/i18n_proof_number_to_currency.git

Examples:
=========
after install you can use this methods in your views:
number_to_euro(88.88) # => 88.88€
number_to_us_dollar(88.88) # => $88.88
number_to_pound(88.88) # => £88.88
number_to_yen(88.88) # => ¥88.88

and you can simply add your own method if you like using
i18n_proof_number_to_currency(number, precision, unit, separator, delimiter, format)

for example you can add to your application_helper:

def number_to_pln(number)
  i18n_proof_number_to_currency(number, 2, "zł", ",", " ", "%n%u")
end
